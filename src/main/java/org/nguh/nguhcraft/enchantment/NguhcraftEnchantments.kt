     * with hypershot enters a state of hypershot, with a counter set
     * to the enchantment level. While in this state, the entity will
     * fire a copy of the projectile every tick, decrementing the counter
     * each time until it reaches zero. The weapon may rapidly lose
     * durability while in this state.
     *
     * If the entity switches weapons, dies, disconnects, is otherwise
     * removed from the world, or the server stops, the hypershot state
     * is cancelled. The weapon cannot be used again while in hypershot
     * state.

     * If the weapon has homing, all projectiles fired by hypershot will
     * have homing; the target selection is done separately for each new
     * projectile.

     * If the weapon has multishot, that many projectiles are fired each
     * tick; the counter is still only decremented once per tick.
